# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this kickstarter project is to help Louise analyze a large data set of different campaigns
based on funding goals and launch date. This will ultimately help her in understanding what is necessary 
in order to succeed in future campaigns and what avg outcomess have looked like within the same category.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis for outcomes based on launch date was done by creating pivot tables from the data set 
provided. From there I was able to filter for the parent category of theater goals and launch date 
to see by far, how many goals succeeded, failed or canceled. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Here I was able to use countifs function to filter for number of successful, failed and canceled 
goals for each goals cost range. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did intially come across one intial difficulty, which was understanding whether to recreate another 
pivot table for the second chart or to just create a seperate excel sheet for my analysis, after reading the
hint I was able to move forward and understand my mistake. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
During March to june there was a high amount of successful goals reached around summer time, 
 I also noticed that there is some symetry 
between successful and failed outcomes, so when success was higher, so was failed goals as well.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
There is an inverse relationship, as there are less successful percentage there is a higher percentage failed
This also tells me the ideal range for goals that are to fail more are higher priced, from 20000 to 35k. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitations from this dataset include outliers, or range, not knowing what bias there might be, not every campaign might 
have raised money the same way. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can filter by year to see outcomes by months, for example year of 2008 when the recession hit,
will more likely have failed outcomes than successful due to recession, each year is not the same 
based on socio economic reasons.
